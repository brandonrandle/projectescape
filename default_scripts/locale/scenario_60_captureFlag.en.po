# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Capture opposing team's \"flag\" before they capture yours\n"
"\n"
"The region consists of two halves divided by a line of nebulae and/or "
"markers. The first 5 minutes (configurable) each side decides where to place "
"their flag. The ships closest to the referee station determine the team's "
"flag location during the initial phase. Crossing to the other side during "
"this phase will result in ship destruction. The weapons officer will mark "
"the flag coordinates when the ship reaches the flag location. After the flag "
"hide timer expires, an artifact will be placed at the location representing "
"the team's flag. If no place has been marked, the ship's current location "
"will be used. If the location is outside the game boundaries, the flag will "
"be placed at the nearest in bounds location\n"
"\n"
"Once the flags are placed, the hunt is on. Ships may cross the border in "
"search of the other team's flag, but while they are in the other team's "
"territory they may be tagged by an opponent ship within 0.75U. Being tagged "
"sends you back to your own region with damage to your warp/jump drive. Each "
"flag must be scanned before it can be retrived. Retrieval occurs by getting "
"within 1U of the flag. Being tagged while in posession of the flag drops the "
"flag at the location of the tag event. Cross back to your side with the flag "
"to claim victory\n"
"\n"
"Current version designed for post pandemic event, but the pandemic lasted "
"longer than anticipated. Event was held 23Jan2021 with 14 player ships "
"participating. Enjoy this scenario in your own multiple player ship event."
