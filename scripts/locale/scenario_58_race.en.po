# Scenario description
msgid ""
"Race three laps of four waypoints (1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 1 = 1 lap) in the "
"shortest time. Play for time by yourself, but have more fun with multiple "
"player ships.\n"
"\n"
"Placement points depend on the number of racers present at the starting "
"point when the race starts. Precise values are given to Relay at that time. "
"Each target drone of yours shot earns one point. Shoot an opponent's drone "
"and they get the point.\n"
"\n"
"Before the race starts, scope out the course, visit some stations, maybe "
"improve your ship for the race. But, watch your time carefully. If you are "
"not at waypoint 1 at the start of the race, your ship will be destroyed. "
"Your competitors may also try to destroy you despite being your nominal "
"allies, so beware\n"
