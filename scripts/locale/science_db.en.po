"Nebulae are the birthing places of new stars. These gas fields, usually "

"gravitational pull of its gas molecules. Because of the ever-changing nature "
"of gas nebulae, most radar and scanning technologies are unable to penetrate "

"A black hole is a point of supercondensed mass with a gravitational pull so "
"powerful that not even light can escape it. It has no locally detectable "
"features, and can only be seen indirectly by blocking the view and "
"distorting its surroundings, creating a strange circular mirror image of the "
"galaxy. The black disc in the middle marks the event horizon, the boundary "
"where even light can't escape it anymore. \n"
"\t\n"
"On the sensors, a black hole appears as a disc indicating the zone where the "
"gravitational pull is getting dangerous, and soon will be stronger then the "
"ship's impulse engines. An object that crosses a black hole is drawn toward "
"its center and quickly ripped apart by the gravitational forces."

"A wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a phenomena that "
"connects two points of spacetime. Jump drives operate in a similar fashion, "
"but instead of being created at will, a wormhole occupies a specific "
"location in space. Objects that enter a wormhole instantaneously emerge from "
"the other end, which might be anywhere from a few feet to thousands of light "
"years away. \n"
"\n"
"Wormholes are rare, and most can move objects in only one direction. "
"Traversable wormholes, which are stable and allow for movement in both "
"directions, are even rarer. All wormholes generate tremendous sensor "
"activity, which an astute science officer can detect even through "
"disruptions such as nebulae."
